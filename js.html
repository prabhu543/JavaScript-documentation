                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>A machine tool is a machine for handling or machining metal or other rigid 
                    materials, usually by cutting, boring, grinding, shearing, or other forms of 
                    deformations. Machine tools employ some sort of tool that does the cutting or shaping. 
                    All machine tools have some means of constraining the work piece and provide a 
                    guided movement of the parts of the machine. Thus, the relative movement between 
                    the workpiece and the cutting tool (which is called the toolpath) is controlled or 
                    constrained by the machine.

                <p>Feedback devices: for the accurate operation of a CNC machine, the positional 
                    values and speed of the axes needs to be continuously updated. This is done by 
                    the feedback devices.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>A turning center is a lathe with a computer numerical control. Sophisticated turning 
                    centers can also perform a variety of milling and drilling operations.  
                    CNC turning centers are advanced computer numerically controlled machines. They 
                    can have 3, 4, or even 5 axes, along with a multitude of cutting capabilities, including 
                    milling, drilling, tapping, and of course, turning. 
                    CNC Turning is commonly used for cylindrical shaped workpieces, however, it can be 
                    used for square or hexagonal-shaped raw materials. The workpiece is held in place by 
                    a 'chuck'. The' chuck' spins at varying RPMs (rotations per minute). Unlike a 
                    traditional lathe, today's machines are numerically controlled.</p>
